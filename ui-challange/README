# User Interface Engineer Coding Challenge 

After reading the task description and user stories, I had a basic design in mind and started working on it, prioritizing functionality over style.

To my understanding, in plain JavaScript there is no simple way to store information in a local JSON file without the use of server that could handle requests.
So the information that would be stored somewhere else, is stored in memory, in a simple array, and thus they are not persistent. And technically speaking, it is not even necessary for the app to function.

## The functionality includes
- To-Do list - you can add/remove/update a list of tasks. The tasks have a title, a description and a completion marker.

- View details - to view, update or remove a To-Do item. First click the details button, then the menu on the side will update with the possible actions and item details.

- Drag-and-Drop - you can rearrange the To-Do items in any order. Just drag any item over any other item and it will be placed beneath the target.

- Keyboard controls: TAB - tab over selectable items and inputs; SHIFT + TAB - tab over in the reverse direction; ENTER - trigger selected element;

## Running The Application
To run the application, clone the project and then open the "index.html" file in any modern browser.
