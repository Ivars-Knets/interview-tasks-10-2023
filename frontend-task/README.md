# Frontend Task

The task was to make the specified React application with Typescript and Styled-Components using Yarn. And optionally using [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

## Installation

To install the application :
- you will need to clone the repository. 
- open a command line, and navigate to the directory where you placed the repository. (If you run into issues, try running the command prompt as Administrator)
- install the dependencies by
```bash
yarn install
```


## Running The Application
To run the application in Development mode, first go through the installation process.
After that you will be able to run the application in Development mode, by
```bash
yarn start
```

To run the application in production mode, you will need a server capable of hosting a website. Be it a local NodeJS server, or a remote website hosting server.
Assuming you have a server, you will need to run 
```bash
yarn build
```
And after that is done, go to "/build" folder and move all the contents of the folder to the server.
